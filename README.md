# Flappy Bird NYC

Inspired by the addictive Flappy Bird game.

NYC pigeons face difficulties daily. Inspired by the addictive Flappy Bird game, help your pigeon explore the city that never sleeps, while avoiding skyscrapers, falling taxis and subway cars.

The game is played with a side-scroller camera angle with the NYC backdrop. The screen follows the pigeon as the player moves up and down to control the bird,  as it attempts to fly in between random NYC buildings, taxis, and subway cars.

This game was created using VS Code, CSS, HTML and JavaScript and displayed on gitHub pages.

Honestly, a little bummed I didn't complete my game. Could not figure out hit detection for the life of me! Will complete this game eventually. With what I found, I couldn't understand enough to implement sadly. Til next time Flappy Fans!!
